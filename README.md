## Why I Built This

I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc
```

That's it. Verify with `/gsd:help` inside your Claude Code interface.

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Check for updates periodically:

```
/gsd:whats-new
```

Update with:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)</strong></summary>

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --local    # Install to ./.claude/
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the interactive prompt.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Development Installation</strong></summary>

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
node bin/install.js --local
```

Installs to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.

</details>

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

> [!TIP]
> This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Granular Permissions</strong></summary>

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(date:*)",
      "Bash(echo:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(mkdir:*)",
      "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(head:*)",
      "Bash(tail:*)",
      "Bash(sort:*)",
      "Bash(grep:*)",
      "Bash(tr:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "Bash(git log:*)",
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git tag:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

## How It Works

### 1. Initialize Project (~10 minutes)

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what's v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you're ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

### 2. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1   # Optional: clarify UI/UX/behavior decisions first
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

**discuss-phase** (optional) — If the phase has gray areas (UI choices, UX flows, behavior decisions), discuss them first. Creates `CONTEXT.md` that guides planning. Skip if you trust the system's defaults.

**plan-phase** — The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this specific phase
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops if needed

Ready when plans pass verification.

### 3. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero degradation
3. **Verifies code** — Checks against phase goals when complete

### 4. Repeat

```
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone   # When all phases done
```

Loop plan → execute until milestone complete. Ship your MVP. Start next milestone.

---

## Existing Projects (Brownfield)

Already have code? Start here instead.

### 1. Map the codebase

```
/gsd:map-codebase
```

Spawns parallel agents to analyze your code. Creates `.planning/codebase/` with structured analysis of your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns.

### 2. Initialize and build

```
/gsd:new-project
```

Same flow as greenfield, but the system knows your codebase. Questions focus on what you're adding/changing. Then plan → execute as normal.

The codebase docs load automatically during planning. Claude knows your patterns, conventions, and where to put things.

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don't.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you're going, what's done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

Size limits based on where Claude's quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Subagent Execution

As Claude fills its context window, quality degrades. You've seen it: *"Due to context limits, I'll be more concise now."* That "concision" is code for cutting corners.

GSD prevents this. Each plan is maximum 3 tasks. Each plan runs in a fresh subagent — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage.

| Task | Context | Quality |
|------|---------|---------|
| Task 1 | Fresh | ✅ Full |
| Task 2 | Fresh | ✅ Full |
| Task 3 | Fresh | ✅ Full |

No degradation. Walk away, come back to completed work.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You're never locked in. The system adapts.

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not found after install?**
- Restart Claude Code to reload slash commands
- Verify files exist in `~/.claude/commands/gsd/` (global) or `./.claude/commands/gsd/` (local)

**Commands not working as expected?**
- Run `/gsd:help` to verify installation
- Re-run `npx get-shit-done-cc` to reinstall

**Updating to the latest version?**
```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

**Using Docker or containerized environments?**

If file reads fail with tilde paths (`~/.claude/...`), set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` before installing:
```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/youruser/.claude npx get-shit-done-cc --global
```
This ensures absolute paths are used instead of `~` which may not expand correctly in containers.
