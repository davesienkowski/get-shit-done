# Compact Instructions

When compacting a GSD project (.planning/ directory exists), preserve:
1. Current position: which phase, plan, and task are active
2. What is being built: the active plan's objective
3. Decisions made this session and their rationale
4. Blockers or concerns
5. What action was in progress when compaction triggered

After compaction, read .planning/STATE.md to restore full project context.
If an active plan exists (PLAN.md without SUMMARY.md), read it to understand current work.
